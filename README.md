# NBA Viewership Analytics – MSBA 324 Final Project

**Team Project | Golden Gate University | Dec 2024**

## 📌 Objective
Analyze how top NBA scorers influence viewership and fan engagement through regression, clustering, and time series modeling.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- R (lm, kmeans, auto.arima)
- NBA Kaggle dataset
- Social media engagement analysis

## 📈 Key Methods
- Regression Analysis: TS%, AST, REB as predictors of PTS
- K-Means Clustering: Player and team groupings based on impact
- Time Series Forecasting: Future trend of NBA viewership

## 🧠 Results
- TS% and AST are strong predictors of scoring
- Predicted 5% rise in average points and viewership over next 5 seasons
- High-engagement players like Harden and Booker are key drivers
